# Games Tech 101: Group Project
 
> Refer to [blackboard](https://blackboard.uwe.ac.uk) for the latest and most
> up to date version of the game brief.


## PyASGE API

The latest [API documentation](https://huxyuk.github.io/pyasge/) for PyASGE is 
available online via GitHub and provides a detailed overview of PyASGE of the
classes and how to use them. 


## Deliverables & Submission

You will need to provide the following:

- Source code submitted via GitHub classroom.
  - **You must not delete the boilerplate code or the structure it provides.**
- A short video or "Let's Play" of your game in action.
  - **It should be compressed using an appropriate codec.**
- A group viva to discuss the code-base and each team members contribution.
  
Submission is via Blackboard.
- Please submit the URL to your source code along with a copy of the video.

> Part of the submission process is to complete a viva with your team. We will use
> this session to weight each team members contributions. During the viva each team
> member will be asked to select a section of their code and to describe its
> implementation.

## Tips 
- Consider programming in pairs if lacking confidence or to help support each other. 
- If you want audio support, you can consider SoLoud audio engine. 
- Kenney.nl, itch.io or OpenGameArt can be used to obtain free assets.


## Introduction 
You didn’t think you were gonna spend all that time and effort on worksheets, and be 
for nothing did ya? Oh noes, now it’s the big one! Time to show us your dev skills in 
all their glory.. It’s time to make a… game shock horror.

## Requirements

- Be in Python and use PyASGE. 
- Have a Top-down play style. Think Zelda, Final Fantasy, Pokemon etc. 
- Use a tile based map system. 
- Have a working game state system i.e. start menu, gameplay etc. 
- Support for both Gamepad and Keyboard/Mouse.
- Contain dynamic game objects that can be spawned and despawned. 
- Design Enemies or NPCs that are capable of path-finding.
- Have Enemies or NPcs use a decision tree to determine their behaviour. 
  
>It is recommended that the group distribute the
work evenly across team members, but also take in to account each team members strengths and weakness. Some people also
find programming in pairs to be work better for them.
